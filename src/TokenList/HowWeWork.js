          Stablecoins on XRPL are typically issued by gateways that hold equivalent off-ledger

          through the issuing gateway. However, the XRP Ledger itself cannot enforce off-ledger
          obligations, so the reliability of stablecoins depends on the trustworthiness of their
          issuers. Users should perform due diligence before engaging with stablecoin offerings. An
